In this project, we have first scrapped the required data from websites like Intel, Geekbench 5
and GSMArena using a python-based web scraping tool called scrapy. Once we have the data,
we clean the data to perform the analysis on the data. This data is used to predict the
smartphone price and the SoC price. These prices are predicted using Deep Neural Network
and Multivariate Linear Regression. With the help of this, we want to help the consumer in
making a better choice in purchasing their smartphone. With the SoC price prediction the
consumer can actually know the price of the chipset which the manufacturers do not reveal to
anyone, this data can be used to better understand the cost-to-performance graph.
